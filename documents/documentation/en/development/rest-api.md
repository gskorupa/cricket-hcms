# REST API

The API provides access to the content stored in the HCMS database.

When HCMS is running as part of a demo website, the REST API is available for online browsing at [http://localhost:8082/q/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8082/q/swagger-ui/).

On a different installation, the REST API URL depends on the configuration of the service.

Look at the [Running demo website with Docker Compose](running-with-docker-compose.md) for more information on how to run the demo website with the HCMS service.
