Cricker HCMS is a headless content management system. Running as a service, it provides a REST API for managing documents. 

The documents are stored in a memory based repository. The repository is loaded from a folder containing the documents. The documents are stored in a tree structure, in files in Markdown format, with `.md` extension. The documents can contain metadata and summary. Both metadata and summary are stored in HTML comments at the beginning of the document.
