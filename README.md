# Cricket HCMS

Cricket HCMS is a headless content management system designed for developers looking for an easy and quick to implement HCMS solution. It is a lightweight, file-based CMS that provides a REST API for content retrieval. 

<!--
## Features

1. File Indexing:
  - Cricket HCMS efficiently indexes files from a configured folder and its subdirectories.
  - It ensures that your content is organized and accessible.
2. Content Format Support:
  - Cricket HCMS embraces both Markdown and HTML formats for content creation.
  - Additionally, it handles binary files seamlessly.
3. REST API Interface:
  - The system provides a robust REST API, allowing seamless integration with any presentation layer.
  - Developers can retrieve documents programmatically for dynamic rendering.
4, Custom Document Parameters:
  - Cricket HCMS recognizes additional parameters defined within Markdown or HTML files.
  - These parameters enhance document metadata and allow for flexible customization.
5. Automated Document Updates:
  - The CMS monitors changes in source files and automatically updates the document database.
  - This ensures that your content remains up-to-date without manual intervention.
6. Forcing Indexing via API:
  - Users can trigger indexing by invoking the CMS API.
  - This feature is useful when immediate updates are necessary.

Note: Cricket HCMS does not offer a web-based interface for document creation or editing. Users must prepare their folder structure and files using tools of their choice (e.g., Git repositories for version control). Depending on the chosen approach, files on the CMS server can be synchronized with source files using `git pull` or other file transfer methods like FTP, rsync, or `scp` command.
